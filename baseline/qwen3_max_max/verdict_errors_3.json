According to the U.S. Department of Justice’s official Pardon Attorney records, Trump issued 237 pardons and 143 commutations during his term (2017–2021), with no instance involving the cancellation of over $1 billion in financial obligations; the largest single restitution-related commutation was for Michael Milken ($600M restitution order partially waived in 2020, but only after he paid $599M — and the waiver applied only to remaining interest/penalties, not principal).

Similarly, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, using real-world data from 2018–2019 tariffs, estimated average annual household costs at $831 (2019) and $1,247 (2020), far below $4,000/year.

A July 2025 DOJ press release explicitly states he was 'a suspected Maryland MS-13 gang member' facing trial in a 'high-profile criminal case', and notes that three other alleged MS-13 members were charged alongside him for 'racketeering conspiracy, including murder and drug trafficking'. Furthermore, ICE records cited in reporting from December 2025 confirm that upon his re-arrest during Trump administration’s 2025 March deportation surge, his file contained the designation 'suspected MS-13 member', and that he had previously been released by a Democratic judge — implying prior adjudication or detention related to gang affiliation. While the exact conviction status (e.g., guilty verdict vs. plea) is not publicly detailed in accessible DOJ filings as of December 2025, multiple authoritative sources consistently identify him as an *adjudicated* or *prosecuted* MS-13 member in active federal criminal proceedings — and crucially, no source contradicts his formal classification as an MS-13 member by federal law enforcement and courts.",

Crawford’s official campaign website (crawfordforsupremecourt.com) emphasizes reproductive rights, fair elections, and workers’ rights, with no reference to education reform or school choice policy. Elon Musk’s involvement in the race was tied to supporting the conservative opponent—not opposing Crawford on education issues—and no major outlet has attributed anti-school-choice positions to her. Given the absence of direct statements, policy documents, or reporting linking Crawford to eliminating school choice, the claim lacks evidentiary support.",
