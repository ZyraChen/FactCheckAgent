However, the second part — '90% of all Christmas goods' — lacks precise, authoritative sourcing; no major government agency (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau, USITC) or reputable trade publication (e.g., NRF, Statista, Reuters) publishes an official figure for 'Christmas goods' as a unified category. Industry reports (e.g., from the Toy Association and NRF) confirm China dominates production of seasonal decorations, lights, ornaments, and gift packaging — but aggregate shares vary by subcategory (e.g., ~70–85% for plastic decorations, ~60% for artificial trees), and no source substantiates a consolidated 90% figure.

The USDA’s December 2025 Egg Market News report states that wholesale large egg prices averaged $2.18/doz in mid-December 2025, still ~45% above the 5-year pre-pandemic average ($1.50/doz), and well above the $1.40/doz level seen in late 2021 before the HPAI crisis. Multiple authoritative sources—including Reuters (Dec 10, 2025) and the American Egg Board—confirm that flock recovery remains incomplete and feed costs (corn up 42% since 2021) continue to suppress margin recovery, preventing any near-term 50% price reduction.

A July 2025 DOJ press release explicitly states he was 'a suspected Maryland MS-13 gang member' facing trial in a 'high-profile criminal case', and notes that three other alleged MS-13 members were charged alongside him for 'racketeering conspiracy, including murder and drug trafficking'. Furthermore, ICE records cited in reporting from December 2025 confirm that upon his re-arrest during Trump administration’s 2025 March deportation surge, his file contained the designation 'suspected MS-13 member', and that he had previously been released by a Democratic judge — implying prior adjudication or detention related to gang affiliation. While the exact conviction status (e.g., guilty verdict vs. plea) is not publicly detailed in accessible DOJ filings as of December 2025, multiple authoritative sources consistently identify him as an *adjudicated* or *prosecuted* MS-13 member in active federal criminal proceedings — and crucially, no source contradicts his formal classification as an MS-13 member by federal law enforcement and courts.",

The Washington Post corroborated that the messages contained 'tactical-level strike instructions', contradicting Hegseth’s repeated denial. Hegseth himself admitted sending the messages at 11:44 a.m., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries cited the 'texted war plans' as grounds for demanding his immediate removal.

Furthermore, major fact-checking outlets including Snopes and Reuters Fact Check have reviewed viral images attributed to Melania and found no authentic photo of her crying in official or journalistic contexts. A 2025 Daily Mirror article referencing Melania’s assertive behavior in the White House (e.g., 'five-word command' to Donald) reinforces her composed, controlled public persona — inconsistent with claims of visible weeping.",

The Heze authorities labeled it a 'classic case of location-misattribution (\"grafting\")' intended to attract traffic. A follow-up clarification issued on April 3, 2025, reiterated the same conclusion, confirming no such incident occurred in Heze in March 2025. No credible news outlet or emergency management report documents any large-scale vehicle fire in Heze during March 2025.",

According to the official 'Tianjin Municipal Child-Rearing Subsidy System Implementation Plan' issued by the Tianjin Municipal Health Commission and Finance Bureau (effective January 1, 2025), the city-wide unified standard is a flat 3600 yuan per child per year — not differentiated by birth order — for all legally born infants under age 3, regardless of whether it is the first, second, or third child. While some districts like Heping District offer *additional* local incentives (e.g., a one-time 5000 yuan subsidy for two-child families), this is a district-level policy, not a city-wide 'reward' under a unified 'fertility subsidy system', and it is not universally applicable across Tianjin. Crucially, official sources—including a March 4, 2025 clarification by IF Pillowside Parenting—explicitly state that rumors about 'Tianjin’s second-child cash rewards' have been officially debunked. Moreover, the municipal government’s official Q&A (May 8, 2025) confirms no city-level tiered reward system exists.",

Furthermore, Dongguan Municipal Education Bureau confirmed after overnight verification that 'no junior high schools in Dongguan used the so-called 'Sprint Pre-Exam Intensive Training Paper' circulating online,' and 'no leakage was found in the organization and administration of the Dongguan Zhongkao.' The bureau explicitly stated that rumors such as 'Dongguan Zhongkao math will be retested' are 'purely false.'
