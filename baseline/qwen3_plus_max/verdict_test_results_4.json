Además, Snopes y PolitiFact han revisado recientemente afirmaciones similares sobre imágenes manipuladas o descontextualizadas relacionadas con inmigración y candidaturas políticas, y han clasificado varias como falsas o engañosas. Por ejemplo, Snopes desmintió una imagen viral similar del 2024 atribuida erróneamente a ICE, identificándola como una recreación teatral sin relación con operativos reales.",

According to the 2023 Electoral Integrity Project’s U.S. State Voting Index, Wisconsin ranked 18th out of 50 states in overall electoral accessibility (moderate restrictions, not 'extreme'). The Brennan Center for Justice’s 2024 Voting Laws Roundup notes Wisconsin’s ID law and absentee ballot witness requirement but does not classify it as a top-tier restrictive state like Georgia, Texas, or Florida, which enacted broader post-2020 restrictions. Additionally, the MIT Election Data and Science Lab’s 2022–2024 state-by-state analysis shows Wisconsin permits same-day registration and no-excuse absentee voting—features absent in many stricter states.

While some political figures (e.g., Trump in 2018 and again in 2024 campaign materials) proposed executive orders to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, legal scholars and major news outlets uniformly report such actions would be unconstitutional without a constitutional amendment.

According to Reuters Fact Check (published October 12, 2023), a widely shared video falsely attributed to RFK Jr. endorsing 'ozone therapy' for type 1 diabetes was digitally manipulated — the audio was spliced from an unrelated 2021 podcast appearance where he discussed vaccine policy, not diabetes treatments. PolitiFact (June 2024) reviewed over 20 alleged videos circulating on X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok and found no verifiable instance where RFK Jr. endorsed any alternative diabetes therapy; all were either miscontextualized, AI-generated, or fabricated. The American Diabetes Association and FDA have issued no records or warnings linking RFK Jr. to promotion of alternative diabetes interventions.",

In Wisconsin, Stein received only 15,879 votes (0.3%) in the 2024 general election — far fewer than the ~22,000-vote margin by which Harris lost the state to Trump, making it implausible that Stein 'cost' Harris the state.
