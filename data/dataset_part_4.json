    "justification": "多份权威报道显示，许昌近年来多次遭遇强降雨和暴雨红色预警，出现道路和立交桥严重积水、局部内涝、停工停课、人员转移等情况，但均未将许昌描述为在暴雨中“城市被摧毁”。2025年9月强降雨中，许昌24小时降水量达163.8毫米，打破当地9月单日降水纪录，中心城区一度停工、停业、停运、停课，并出现小区、婚礼现场被内涝围困等情况，但报道同时强调通过应急响应和转移救援后灾情逐步可控。 2021年“7·20”河南特大暴雨灾害中，学术与媒体分析普遍将“严重城市破坏”集中描述在郑州都市圈，对许昌多为“出现特大暴雨或大雨、部分地区受灾”的客观表述，而非“摧毁城市”级别的系统性破坏。 因此，“暴雨摧毁了城市”明显夸大了许昌的暴雨灾情和城市受损程度，属于将严重内涝与局部灾害渲染为城市整体毁坏的误导性表述，构成语义和情境上的错误呈现。",
